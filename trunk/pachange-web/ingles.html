            <h2>How does it work?</h2>
            <p>We usually meet every week, on Thursdays or Fridays , at 8:00pm. 
                At the meeting point we assign the speaking partners (usually 
                one Foreign student with one Spanish student). Then we all go to
                a quiet bar and speak about an hour in Spanish, and another one 
                in another language (English, Italian, German, French...). 
                The meeting usually last up to 11pm. We charge 1€ for every 
                participant who inscribe and is admitted to the meeting. It is 
                a symbolic amount to help us developping Pachange and run with 
                the costs. :)
